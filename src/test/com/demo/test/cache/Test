Steps
Clone source code from git
$  git clone https://github.com/dstar55/docker-hello-world-spring-boot .
Build project with Maven
$ mvn clean install
Move application to data folder
$ mv ./target/hello*.jar ./data
Build Docker image
$ docker build -t="hello-world-java" .
Note:if you run this command for first time it will take some time in order to download base image from DockerHub

Run Docker image
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -it --rm hello-world-java
Test application
first you need to find ContainerId of the running Docker image

$ docker ps
you can find ContainerId in a row where IMAGE column contains 'hello-world-java' phrase

then you need to find IP address of the running Docker image

$ docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' [ContainerId]
now test application

$ curl [IPAddress]:8080
the respone should be

Hello World
